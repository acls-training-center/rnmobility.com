Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of it's
citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are
not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what
is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving
across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this
page.

For foreign nurses, if your original state of licensure does not
directly provide verification of your foreign education credentials, you
will need to submit official nursing school transcripts provided through
[CGFNS](https://www.cgfns.org/) and an official copy of high school
diploma or equivalent, or official transcripts. All documents must be
accompanied with a certified English translation if not in English.

unless their license has been expired for more than three years. Click
