Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some healthcare professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsement

- Completed, notarized application and fee ($50) must be mailed to the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency, not the Board of Nursing.
- Photo (2.5 x 3.5).
- Proof of your active current license from another state.
- Provide any legal name change documents.
- Verification of licensure from your original licensing state. You may provide any documents proving your graduation from an accredited program to the Indiana State Board of Nursing. Submit a [NURSYS Verification](https://www.nursys.com/) form to The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN). For states that do not use the NURSYS program, send a [Verification of State Licensure Form](https://www.in.gov/pla/license/free-search-and-verify/) to your state of original licensure and return this form to the Indiana Board. You must send verification from every state where you hold or have held a license.
- Criminal background check. Follow the [Criminal Background Check Instructions](https://www.in.gov/pla/professions/nursing-home/nursing-licensing-information/).
- Passing NCLEX or State Board Test Pool Examination scores.
- U.S. Social Security number.

For foreign nurses, if your original state of licensure does not directly provide verification of your foreign education credentials, submit official nursing school transcripts provided through [CGFNS](https://www.cgfns.org/) and an official copy of your high school diploma or equivalent, or official transcripts. All documents must be accompanied by a certified English translation if not in English.

#### Continuing competency

RNs are not required to take continuing education courses for renewal unless their license has been expired for more than three years. Click [here](https://www.in.gov/pla/professions/nursing-home/nursing-licensing-information/#Continuing_Education_Requirements) for details.

Contact the State Board for more details. Contact information is provided at the bottom of this page.

#### Renewals

Renewals occur by October 31 on odd-numbered years. Renewal fee is $50.

#### This state requires nurses to hold current [ACLS certification](https://www.acls.net/indiana-acls-pals-bls)
