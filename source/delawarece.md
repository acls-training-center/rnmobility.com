Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of it's
citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are
not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what
is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving
across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this
page.

    years, or

-   You must complete a refresher course that is approved by the Board.

#### Continuing Competency

Your license will expire on odd number years on either the 28th of
February, the 31 of May, or the 30th of September. You will also need to
work either 1,000 hours as a nurse over the past five years or 400 hours
over the past two years in order to
[renew](https://dpr.delaware.gov/boards/nursing/renewal/).

If your license is issued by endorsement and you have had it at least
one year but less than two years, you will need 15 contact hours to
renew. If you have had your license over two years you will need 30
contact hours to renew. If you had your Delaware license less than a
year before your first renewal, you will not need any continuing
education contact hours. Visit the [1900 Board of Nursing
page](https://regulations.delaware.gov/AdminCode/title24/1900.shtml)
and read section 9.0 for rules and regulations pertaining to mandatory
continuing education

If you graduated from a nursing program outside the United States
(including Canada) or in Puerto Rico, you will need to provide a copy of
your [CGFNS certificate](https://www.cgfns.org/) or [CES
report](https://www.cgfns.org/services/credentials-evaluation/credentials-evaluation-service-professional-report/).
