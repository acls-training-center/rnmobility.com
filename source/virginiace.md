Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of it's citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

Virginia is a compact state. If you are moving to Virginia or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for application by endorsement in order to use your license in Virginia. General instructions are listed below.

*   You must satisfy the same requirments of an applicant seeking an original Virginia license
