Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

You can reach the page covering endorsements [here](https://wsbn.wyo.gov/licensing).

Near the top of the page, you should see a link to the [application for endorsement](https://nursing-online.state.wy.us/Resources/RN%20Endorsement%20App%204-22-2013.pdf).

In order to receive licensure by verification, you must:

*   Submit a complete application. Incomplete applications will not be accepted.
*   Provide proof of having completed a Board-approved RN training program.
*   Submit applicable fees.
*   You must not be under disciplinary action or have committed any acts that may result in disciplinary action.

You will have to undergo a background check. You will be sent a fingerprint card after the Board receives your application and fees. It is possible that the Board will send you a temporary license, which is non-renewable and expires in thirty days.

You will have to provide proof of hours practiced, continuing education, and specialty certification upon renewal as well. Renewals occur every even-numbered year on the 31st of December.

#### Continuing competency

If you are not a newly licensed RN, the Board will require you to either have worked at least 500 hours as an RN in the last two years or 1,600 hours within the last five years. They will also require proof that you have completed at least 20 hours of RN continuing education during the last two years. Finally, they will require proof that you were certified in some area of specialty in the last five years. The certification must be nationally recognized.

If you are a newly licensed RN, you will need to provide proof that you have passed the NCLEX-RN within the last five years in lieu of experience and continuing education.
