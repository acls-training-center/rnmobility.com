The Alaska Board of Nursing is committed to protecting the health of
Alaska's citizens. Registered nurse licenses are handled through the
Professional Licensing division of Alaska's Department of Commerce,
Community, and Economic Development. Alaska is not a compact state, so
it is important to know what the Board's licensing requirements are when
seeking endorsement of your nursing license.

### [Endorsements](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/5/pub/nur4016.pdf)

[Application for license
endorsement](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/5/pub/nur4016.pdf)
is required for nurses who received their license in another state. The
requirements for endorsement are listed below.

-   Complete, sign, and notarize your application. Be sure to include a
    passport type photo taken within six months of submitting your
    application
-   Submit appropriate fees via check or money order
  -   Application for Endorsement Total: \$275.00
  -   Total if temporary is permit included: \$325.00
-   Completed fingerprint card provided or approved by the Alaska Board
    of Nursing.

    avaible by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN)
    online system ([www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/)).

the time your permanent license is issued by the board.

Canadian nurses who have not taken the NCLEX exam should click
[here](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/5/pub/nur4112.pdf)for
exam requirements.

-   A Department provided form documenting 320 hours of employment as a
    nursing is required. The documented hours must be within two years
    of the Board of Nursing reception of the application. If 320 hours
    cannot be documented, a Board approved refresher course may be
    taken. Similarly, a refresher course is required for those who have
    not practiced nursing within the last five years. Refresher courses
    can be found at
    [www.nursing.alaska.gov](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardofNursing/ApplicantInformation/RefresherCourseInformation).

-   Graduates from a registered nurse or practical nurse program outside
    the US and Canada (except Quebec) or anywhere English is not the
    primary language, Canada, where English is not the primary must pass
    either the [International English Language Testing
    System](https://ielts.org/test_takers_information.aspx) or the
    [Test of English as a Foreign Language](https://www.ets.org/toefl.html)
    satisfactory scores. Minimum score requirements can be found
    [here](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardofNursing/ApplicantInformation/ForeignEducatedNurseRequirements.aspx).

### Continuing Competency

Applicants must be aware of continuing education (CE) requirements. RN's
must complete at least two of the methods listed below in order to
maintain [continuing
competency](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardofNursing/ApplicantInformation/ContinuedCompetencyInformation.aspx).

-   Continuing education (30 contact hours With not more than 10 of the
    contact hours earned through in-service nursing education offered by
    a licensed health care facility)

-   Unpaid or non-compensated professional activities (30 hours)

-   Employment as a registered nurse (320 hours)

Guidelines governing these methods or alternatives can be found in
article six of the [Statutes and Regulations for
Nursing](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/5/pub/NursingStatutes.pdf).

Click
[here](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/5/pub/nur4268.pdf)to
locate documentation forms for CE or professional activities.

The following areas should fulfill CE requirements:

-   Practice areas for nursing and special health care problems

-   Science coursework (biology, behavioral sciences, or physical
    sciences)

-   Legal or ethical coursework in health care

-   Health Management or health administration focusing on patient care
    or personnel

Subjects that are both board approved by the board required for
completion of an advanced, formal nursing program. This does not include
courses taken for an initial license.

Keep in mind that contact hours do not necessarily equate to semester
hours. Each semester credit hour equals fifteen contact hours. Each
quarter credit hour equals ten contact hours.
