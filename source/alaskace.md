The Alaska Board of Nursing is committed to protecting the health of Alaska's citizens. Registered nurse licenses are handled through the Professional Licensing division of Alaska's Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. Alaska is not a compact state, so it is important to know what the Board's licensing requirements are when seeking endorsement of your nursing license.

### [Endorsements](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/5/pub/nur4016.pdf)

[Application for license endorsement](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/5/pub/nur4016.pdf) is required for nurses who received their license in another state. The requirements for endorsement are listed below.

-   Complete, sign, and notarize your application. Be sure to include a passport-type photo taken within six months of submitting your application.
-   Submit appropriate fees via check or money order:
  -   Application for Endorsement Total: **$275.00**
  -   Total if a temporary permit is included: **$325.00**
-   Submit a completed fingerprint card provided or approved by the Alaska Board of Nursing.
-   License verification is required. It may be sent from or made available by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) online system ([www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/)).

-   To view fingerprint information and requirements, click [here](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/5/pub/adm4637.pdf "Fingerprint information and checklist").
-   Foreign graduates must also complete a credential evaluation from [CGFNS](https://www.cgfns.org/ "link to Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools home page").

**Note:** Your license must be current at the time of application and when your permanent license is issued by the board.

Canadian nurses who have not taken the NCLEX exam should click [here](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/5/pub/nur4112.pdf) for exam requirements.

-   A department-provided form documenting **320 hours** of employment as a nurse within two years is required. If 320 hours cannot be documented, a Board-approved refresher course must be taken. A refresher course is also required for nurses who have not practiced in the last five years. Refresher courses can be found at [nursing.alaska.gov](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardofNursing/ApplicantInformation/RefresherCourseInformation).

-   Graduates from a registered nurse or practical nurse program outside the US and Canada (except Quebec) or anywhere English is not the primary language must pass either the [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](https://ielts.org/take-a-test/why-choose-ielts) or the [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](https://www.ets.org/toefl.html) with satisfactory scores. Minimum score requirements can be found [here](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardofNursing/ApplicantInformation/ForeignEducatedNurseRequirements.aspx).

### Continuing competency

Applicants must be aware of continuing education (CE) requirements. RNs must complete at least two of the methods listed below to maintain [continuing competency](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardofNursing/ApplicantInformation/ContinuedCompetencyInformation.aspx).

-   Continuing education (30 contact hours, with no more than 10 hours earned through in-service nursing education offered by a licensed health care facility)
-   Unpaid or non-compensated professional activities (30 hours)
-   Employment as a registered nurse (320 hours)

Guidelines governing these methods or alternatives can be found in article six of the [Statutes and Regulations for Nursing](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/5/pub/NursingStatutes.pdf).

Click [here](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/5/pub/nur4268.pdf) to locate documentation forms for CE or professional activities.

The following areas should fulfill CE requirements:

-   Practice areas for nursing and special health care problems
-   Science coursework (biology, behavioral sciences, or physical sciences)
-   Legal or ethical coursework in health care
-   Health Management or health administration focusing on patient care or personnel

Subjects must be board-approved or required for completion of an advanced, formal nursing program. This does not include courses taken for an initial license.

**Note:** Contact hours do not necessarily equate to semester hours. Each semester credit hour equals **15 contact hours**, and each quarter credit hour equals **10 contact hours**.
