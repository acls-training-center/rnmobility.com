#### Continuing Competency

Registered nurses must complete 30 hours of continuing education in
order to renew their licenses. All courses must be nursing related.

been licensed within the last two years, then you may not have to take
complete an additional 30 hours for your initial license renewal.
However, all RNs must take a one-time, four-hour bioterrorism CE class.
