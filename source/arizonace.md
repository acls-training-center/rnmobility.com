Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

Arizona is a compact state. If you are moving to Arizona or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for licensure by endorsement in order to use your license in Arizona. General instructions are listed below.

1. Provide proof of a passing NCLEX or State Board Test Pool exam score.

2. Applicants must have either a previous license or a current license along with at least **960 hours** of practice in the last five years. Alternatives include:
   - Completing a Board-approved refresher course within the last 5 years.
   - Completing an advanced degree.
   - Graduating from a nursing program and finishing the degree within the last five years.

3. While RN applicants do need to have a diploma or degree, some exceptions apply. These can be found by clicking [here](https://www.azbn.gov/licenses-certifications/apply-for-a-license).

4. Applicants under investigation require approval by the Arizona Board.

-   Application fee: **$150**.
-   Temporary license fee: **$50** (optional).
-   Fingerprint fee: **$50**. To view the fingerprint instruction card, click [here](https://www.azbn.gov/licenses-certifications/fingerprint-card-instructions).

If your state does not participate in the NURSYS verification system, you must complete the [verification form](https://www.azbn.gov/sites/default/files/forms/verification-form-042017.pdf) and mail it to the state of your original license.

For information regarding foreign-educated nurse requirements, click [here](https://www.azbn.gov/licenses-certifications/apply-for-a-license).

Applicants who meet the requirements above should submit their application and fees by mail. Emailed and faxed applications are not accepted. Include verification of your original state of licensure, which can be obtained through [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/) or [www.azbn.gov/RNLPNEndorsement](https://www.azbn.gov/licenses-certifications/apply-for-a-license). Proof of lawful presence in the US must also be provided. For a list of acceptable documents, click [here](https://www.azbn.gov/licenses-certifications/citizenship-and-alien-status).

**Note:** Those with prior licensure in AZ must apply for renewal, not endorsement.

#### Renewal

License renewal costs **$160** plus a **$3 online fee**. To renew online, go to [Arizona State Board of Nursing Renewal Page](https://azbn.boardsofnursing.org/azbn).

Arizona provides information on refresher courses at [this link](https://www.azbn.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/2021.07.06.%20Approved%20Refresher%20Programs.pdf).

#### Continuing competency

Arizona does not have formal continuing education (CE) requirements.

The board requires that you have worked at least **960 hours** in the last five years to renew your license. If you haven't met this requirement, you may take a refresher course. Arizona Board-approved refresher courses can be found [here](https://www.azbn.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/2021.07.06.%20Approved%20Refresher%20Programs.pdf).
