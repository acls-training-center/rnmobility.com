Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some healthcare professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

To be eligible for RN licensure by endorsement in Florida, you must meet one of the following criteria:

- Hold an active RN license in another state.
- Have passed the NCLEX or State Board Test Pool Examination.
- Have practiced in the U.S. for two of the last three years without disciplinary action.

You will need to submit your **endorsement application** and pay the required **$110 application fee**. In addition, Florida requires **Livescan electronic fingerprinting** for all initial licensure applications. Visit the [background screening page](https://flhealthsource.gov/background-screening/) for details on fingerprinting. 

You can verify your license through **Nursys** or submit a license verification form if your state does not participate in the Nursys system.
