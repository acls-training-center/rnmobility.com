Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of it's
citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are
not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what
is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving
across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this
page.

#### Endorsements

Do you currently hold an active license in another state? Have recently
passed the NCLEX or State Board Test Pool Examination? Or, have
practiced in the US (including territories and jurisdictions) for two of
the last three years without any action being taken against your
license? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may be
eligible for endorsement.

You will need to submit your endorsement application with fees. A \$110
application fee will be required. Fees for fingerprints and license
verification vary from one provider to the next. A [Livescan service
provider](https://www.flhealthsource.gov/background-screening/) must take
your fingerprints as well. Livescan electronic fingerprinting is
required for all initial licensure. You will need to download and print
the [Nursing Electronic Fingerprint
Form](https://floridasnursing.gov/forms/electronic-fingerprinting-form-nursing.pdf "Nursing
              Electronic Fingerprint Form") The Board will require
verification of licensure from your original state of licensure. You
will need to verify your current active license with your current state
as well. Copies of licenses will not be accepted. Click

Nursys system you can download and print a [Florida Board of Nursing
License Verification
Form.](https://floridasnursing.gov/forms/nurse-lic-ver-request-info.pdf)

#### Continuing Education Information

You will be required to take 24 hours of continuing education every two
years. You must complete a one time HIV/AIDS course before your first
renewal. Afterward, your 24 hours must include the following

-   Prevention of Medical Errors - Two hours (this course is no longer
    required for new licensure, but it is required for renewal.)

-   Laws and Rules that govern the practice of Nursing - Two hours

Two hours of domestic violence will be required every third renewal; so,
you will have 26 hours of continuing education during those renewal
periods.

Visit [www.cebroker.com](https://www.cebroker.com) for a list of
approved continuing education providers.

For more details, click on the continuing education link in the FAQ
section of this page or call the Board directly. The Boards contact
information is located near the bottom of this page.

The Department of Health, Division of Medical Quality Assurance will
review your continuing education records in the electronic tracking
system at the time of renewal. The tracking system is powered by
CEBroker.

You may convert college courses to CE hours. One credit hour per quarter
converts to 10 contact hours. One credit hour per semester converts to
15 contact hours. To receive continuing education credit, retain
transcripts for four years in case you are audited.
