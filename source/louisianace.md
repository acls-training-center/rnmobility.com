Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of it's
citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are
not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what
is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving
across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this
page.

Foreign educated nurses will be required to pass the Commission on
Foreign Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools qualifying examination.
Fore more details, click [here](https://www.cgfns.org/).

Foreign educated nurses must also obtain a Credentials Evaluation
Service Professional Report (CESPR). You will need to apply for this
report through CGFNS and have a certified copy sent directly to the
Louisiana State Board of Nursing by CGFNS.

A passing score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) or
International English Testing System (IELTS) is also required.

Note: Internationally educated nurses are NOT eligible for the 90-day
temporary permit.
