Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

### Endorsements

Montana refers to endorsements as license by credentialing. The general requirements for license by credentialing include:

- A complete application fee of **$200.00**. You can find the application form [here](http://b.bsd.dli.mt.gov/license/bsd_boards/nur_board/pdf/nur_end_app.pdf).
- Proof of passing the NCLEX or a Board-recognized license exam.
- Proof of all states or locations where you have been licensed in for the last two years. You may verify your license through [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/).
- Foreign transcripts must be evaluated.
- Nurses attending training abroad may need to provide proof of English language proficiency by exam.
- A fingerprint/background check. You must obtain a fingerprint card from a law enforcement agency, which costs **$27.25** to process.

If your state does not participate in the Nursys verification system, you must request verification directly from the board that issued your license. For this, you need to fill out the [Montana Department of Labor & Industry Verification Request](http://b.bsd.dli.mt.gov/license/pdf/verification.pdf) form, which incurs a fee of **$20**.

#### Continuing Competency

Montana does not have mandatory continuing education requirements for renewal. However, RNs are still expected to maintain their competence through continuing education voluntarily. Renewal occurs during even-numbered years on December 31, and the cost is **$100**. For more information, the renewal application can be found [here](http://b.bsd.dli.mt.gov/license/bsd_boards/nur_board/pdf/RN_LPN_renew.pdf).
