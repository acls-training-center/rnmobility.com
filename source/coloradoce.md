Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some healthcare professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

### Endorsements

Colorado is a compact state. If you are moving to Colorado or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for licensure by endorsement in order to use your license in Colorado. General instructions are listed below.

- Complete [application](https://apps2.colorado.gov/DORA/licensing/Default.aspx) and submit a **$43** endorsement application fee.
- Provide proof of **passing NCLEX** results.
- Submit proof of graduation from an approved nursing program.
- Submit **license verification** either through the [Nursys system](https://www.nursys.com/) or, if your state does not participate, by using the [Request for Verification of Original Nursing License Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcCIkZ0X_F4ydi4xhF-0siKl8dCgSDAF/view).

Foreign-educated nurses must submit the **CES Professional report** from the [Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS)](https://www.cgfns.org/).

All RN licenses expire on September 30 of an odd or even-numbered year, depending on when your license was issued. To renew your license, click [here](https://apps2.colorado.gov/DORA/licensing/Default.aspx).
