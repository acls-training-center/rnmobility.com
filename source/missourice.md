Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

Missouri is a compact state. If you are moving to Missouri or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for endorsement to use your license in Missouri. General instructions are listed below:

- Complete, notarized [application](https://pr.mo.gov/boards/nursing/375-0239.pdf) with a fee of **$55**.
- Verification of original licensure through [Nursys](https://www.nursys.com/) or your original state.
- A criminal background check is required, with a fee of **$44.80**. For details, see [here](https://pr.mo.gov/nursing-fingerprints.asp).
- If educated outside the U.S., you must have a credentials evaluation service such as [CGFNS](https://www.cgfns.org/) send a certificate to the board.
- Proof of English-language proficiency must be submitted with one of the following tests:
  1. [TOEFL](https://www.ets.org/toefl.html) with a minimum score of 540 (paper) or 76 (internet-based).
  2. [TOEIC](https://www.ets.org/toeic.html) with a passing score of 725.
  3. [IELTS](https://ielts.org/) with a score of 6.5 (Academic) and a Spoken Band score of 7.

Licenses expire on April 30 of odd-numbered years at a cost of **$60**. For renewal information, click [here](https://pr.mo.gov/nursing-renewal.asp).
