Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of it's
citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are
not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what
is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving
across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this
page.

#### Endorsements

-   Complete, notarized, [paper
    application](https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/licensing/plb/45/lpn_licensure_by_endorsement)
    with \$75 dollar fee

-   Verification of licensure from either
    [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/) or from your current state
    and your state of original licensure if it is different. (note: The
    paper verification included in the application will only be accepted
    if your state does not participate in the Nursys Verification
    system.)

-   Official transcripts

    -   Non-US training programs may need a Professional Report made
        available by the [Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing
        Schools Credentials Evaluation Service.](https://www.cgfns.org/)

-   500 hours of practice as an RN over the last four years. If you
    don't have the required hours, then you may show proof of graduation
    during the last four years or you may complete an approved nursing
    reentry program.

-   Be sure to sign up with
    [COGENTS](https://pci.aps.gemalto.com/gaperlpub/landing_page_1.pl)before
    submitting your application

#### Renewal

page.](https://secure.sos.state.ga.us/mylicense/Login.aspx?process=app)

#### Continuing Competency

Starging January 31, 2016, RNs must complete continuing education and
competency requirements. Be sure to complete the continuing education
requirements before 31 January if your license expires in that month.
Keep your continuing education documents in case you are audited.
Failure to provide the documents will result in an incomplete renewal
application.

Georgia provides five options for license renewal

-   RNs may complete 30 hours of continuing education.

-   Certification (or re-certification) by a Board recognized national
    certifying organization

-   Verification of 500 hours of practice and verification of competence
    by a physicians office or health care facility

-   Graduation from a nursing program or completion of a reentry program
    that is Board recognized

-   Completion of at least a two hour curriculum in nursing or in a
    related field
