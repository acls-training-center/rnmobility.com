Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some healthcare professions vary between states. This is why itâ€™s important to understand what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

To apply for RN licensure by endorsement in Georgia, you must:

- Complete a notarized [application](https://sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/forms/38%20Application%20-%20LPN%20Licensure%20by%20Endorsement.pdf) and pay the **$75 application fee**.
- Submit verification of licensure from either [Nursys](https://www.nursys.com/) or from your current and original state of licensure if they are different. 
- Provide official transcripts if required, and foreign graduates must submit a **Professional Report** from the [CGFNS Credentials Evaluation Service](https://www.cgfns.org/).
- Show proof of **500 hours of RN practice** in the last four years or proof of graduation from a nursing program within the last four years. If you do not meet these criteria, you must complete an approved nursing reentry program.
- Complete a **fingerprint background check**. Visit the [guidelines page](https://sos.ga.gov/sites/default/files/forms/38%20Guidelines%20-%20Nursing%20-%20Fingerprint%20Background%20Check%20Instructions.pdf) for more information [oai_citation:6,Georgia Board of Nursing | Georgia Secretary of State](https://sos.ga.gov/georgia-board-nursing) [oai_citation:5,How to Guide: Registered Nurse | Georgia Secretary of State](https://sos.ga.gov/how-to-guide/how-guide-registered-nurse).
