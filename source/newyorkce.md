Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

New York doesn't have a separate form for endorsement per se; however, you will have a few more steps to take in addition to filling out the initial application for a license in New York.

Below are a few general [requirements you will need for licensure](https://www.op.nysed.gov/professions-index/nursing):

- Proof of completion of an [approved RN training program](https://www.op.nysed.gov/professions-index/nursing)
- Completion of a mandatory course in [identification and reporting of child abuse](https://www.op.nysed.gov/about/training-continuing-education/child-abuse-identification-reporting)
- Completion of an [infectious control course](https://www.op.nysed.gov/about/training-continuing-education/infection-control)
- Complete application with fee of $143.00
- Proof of education
- Proof of passing NCLEX or State Board Test Pool Exam results from either [Nursys](https://www.nursys.com/) or from the jurisdiction in which you took one of the exams
- Verification of licensure (you may use [Nursys](https://www.nursys.com/) if your state participates)

Your license will be valid for life unless it is revoked.
