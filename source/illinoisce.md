Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some healthcare professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsement

- Complete the [application](https://idfpr.illinois.gov/profs/nursing.html) with applicable fees.
- Graduate from an [approved nursing program](https://idfpr.illinois.gov/profs/nursing.html).
- Your SSN is mandatory for the application. If you do not have an SSN, submit a SSN affidavit available on the [Department website](https://idfpr.illinois.gov/profs/nursing.html).
- For nurses educated outside the U.S. and its territories, a credentials evaluation report of your foreign nursing education is required from either [CGFNS](https://www.cgfns.org/) or [ERES](https://www.eres.com/).
- If English is not your first language, provide proof of English-language proficiency by passing and submitting certification of the [TOEFL](https://www.ets.org/toefl.html), or the [IELTS](https://ielts.org/).
- Verification of licensure can be obtained through the [Nursys Verification System](https://www.nursys.com/).

Your license will expire on May 31 of even-numbered years.
