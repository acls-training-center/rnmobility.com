Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsement

- Complete [application](https://www.idfpr.com/Renewals/Apply/Forms/RN-EN.pdf) with applicable fees.
- Graduate from an [approved nursing program](https://www.idfpr.com/renewals/ssn_afft.pdf).
- Your SSN is mandatory for the application. If you do not have a SSN, submit a SSN affidavit available on the [Department website](https://www.idfpr.com/renewals/ssn_afft.pdf).
- For nurses educated outside the U.S and its territories, a credentials evaluation report of your foreign nursing education is required from either [CGFNS](https://www.cgfns.org/) or [ERES](https://www.eres.com/).
- If English is not your first language, provide proof of English-language proficiency by passing and submitting certification of the [TOEFL](https://www.ets.org/toefl.html), or the [IELTS](https://ielts.org/).
- Verification of licensure can be obtained through the [Nursys Verification System](https://www.nursys.com/).
- Fingerprints are required. Visit the [Fingerprint Vendor page](https://www.idfpr.com/LicenseLookUp/fingerprintlist.asp) to see approved vendors. Submit your receipt with the endorsement application.
- Pass a department-approved exam.

Your license will expire on May 31 of even-numbered years.

#### Continuing Competency

You are required to engage in 20 contact hours of continuing education between each renewal period. Starting in 2024, this includes:
- One hour on sexual harassment prevention training.
- One hour of evidence-based implicit bias in healthcare training.
- One hour on diagnosis, treatment, and care of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia types for RNs caring for patients aged 26 or older.
