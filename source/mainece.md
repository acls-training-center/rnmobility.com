Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsement

Maine is a compact state. If you are moving to Maine or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for application by endorsement in order to use your license in Maine. General instructions are listed below.

- Complete, notarized [application](https://www.maine.gov/boardofnursing/licensing/endorsement.html) and \$75 application fee.
- 2x2 passport-style photo, no more than two years old.
- Verification of licensure from any US state or territory or any country where you may have been originally licensed. You may use [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com) if your state participates in Nursys, or you may use the [Maine Verification Form](https://www.maine.gov/boardofnursing/docs/Maine_Verification_Form_RN.pdf).
- Proof of passing NCLEX scores.
- Transcript from an RN program (if applicable).
- US Social Security Number.

Your initial Maine license will be valid for at least one year. Subsequent renewals take place every two years. You may renew [online](https://licensing.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/licensing/begin.pl?board_number=1310) for \$75.

#### Continuing competency

Maine does not have continuing education requirements for RNs. However, foreign educated nurses must provide an original source transcript only upon request after the review of the application. Contact the Board for criminal background check information.
