Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of it's
citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are
not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what
is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving
across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this
page.

#### Endorsements

Mississippi is a compact state. If you are moving to Mississippi or
claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply
for application by endorsement in order to use your license in
Mississippi. General instructions are listed below.

If you live in a state that does not participate in the NURSys system,
you must fill out and mail the notarized Verification of Original
Licensure form to the licensing agency in your state.

-   Complete, notarized
    [application](https://gateway.licensure.msbn.ms.gov/)with fee of
    \$100 (add \$25 if applying for temporary permit)

-   2x2 signed passport style photo

-   Verification of original licensure form

    -   You may also use [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/) if
        your original state participates

-   Official transcripts

    -   foreign transcripts must be evaluated by
        [CGFNS](https://www.cgfns.org/)

-   Fingerprints and criminal background check (\$75)

[Renewals](https://www.msbn.ms.gov/licensure/applications-and-forms)take
place between the 1st of October to the 31st of December during even
