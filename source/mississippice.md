Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

Mississippi is a compact state. If you are moving to Mississippi or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for endorsement to use your license in the state. Here are the general requirements:

- Complete a notarized [application](https://gateway.licensure.msbn.ms.gov/) with a fee of **$100** (add **$25** if applying for a temporary permit).
- Submit a 2x2 signed passport-style photo.
- Verification of original licensure from your previous state or [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/).
- Official transcripts from your nursing program. 
  - Foreign transcripts must be evaluated by the [Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS)](https://www.cgfns.org/).
- Fingerprints and a criminal background check (total cost of **$75**).
- If your original state does not participate in NURSys, you must submit the notarized Verification of Original Licensure form to that state.

Renewals occur every two years from **October 1** to **December 31** during even-numbered years at a cost of **$100** for active licenses. To apply online, click [here](https://gateway.licensure.msbn.ms.gov/).

#### Continuing Competency

There are no mandatory continuing education requirements for endorsement or renewal. You are responsible for your own continuing competency.
