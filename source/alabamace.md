The Alabama Board of Nursing's (ABN) mission is to provide patients with
competent medical staff through regulation and licensing requirements.
If you are interested in working in Alabama, you should be aware of the
ABN's unique licensing requirements. Alabama is not a compact state and
will require licensure by endorsement if you have never held a license
there before. On this page you will find general information regarding
the ABN's endorsement, renewal, and continuing competency requirements

### Continuing Competency

24 contact hours are required for endorsement. There are several methods
for obtaining required contact hours. According to the Alaama Board of
Nursing, "We typically accept CE courses that are approved or accredited
by any state board of nursing, state nurses association, or national
organization such as the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC).
You may search the internet for CE for nurses to locate online
providers." By the way, did you know ACLS.net offers accredited courses?
