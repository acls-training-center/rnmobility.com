The Alabama Board of Nursing's (ABN) mission is to provide patients with competent medical staff through regulation and licensing requirements. Alabama is now a **compact state** under the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC), effective since January 1, 2024. If you do not hold a multi-state license, you will require licensure by endorsement. On this page, you will find general information regarding the ABN's endorsement, renewal, and continuing competency requirements.

### [Endorsements](https://www.abn.alabama.gov/licensing/apply/licensure-by-endorsement/)

Application for license endorsement is required for nurses who received their license in another state. The requirements for endorsement are listed below.

- Apply for [licensure endorsement](https://www.abn.alabama.gov/licensing/apply/licensure-by-endorsement/endorsement-basic-requirements/)
- Complete application (you will need a Social Security Number to complete the application)
- Pay required fees:
  - Application: **$125**
  - Temporary Permit: $50
  - Transaction Fee: $3.50
- You must be a nursing school graduate. Your education program must be either an RN or PN program.
- Original nursing school transcript to be mailed (not faxed) to ABN
- Verification of licensure from your original state’s board of nursing mailed to ABN. Use the [Request for Verification of Nursing License for Endorsement into Alabama form](https://www.abn.alabama.gov/licensing/apply/licensure-by-endorsement/endorsement-basic-requirements/) if the state you were originally licensed in does not participate in NURSYS®.
- Verification of original licensure in states that participate in NURSYS® must be ordered from [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/)
- 24 contact hours of continuing education must have been completed within the last 24 months and mailed or faxed to ABN.
- Proof of citizenship or lawful presence in the US must be submitted to ABN. A checklist for [citizens](https://www.abn.alabama.gov/licensing/apply/licensure-by-endorsement/endorsement-basic-requirements/) and [non-citizens](https://www.abn.alabama.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NonCitizen_Endorsement_Checklist.pdf) can be found on the ABN website.

### Continuing competency

24 contact hours are required for endorsement and renewal. There are several methods for obtaining required contact hours. According to the Alabama Board of Nursing, "We typically accept CE courses that are approved or accredited by any state board of nursing, state nurses association, or national organization such as the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC)." You can also find accredited courses online, such as those offered by ACLS.net.
