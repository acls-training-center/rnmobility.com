      We think finding information about how to transfer your nursing license, renew, and seek continuing education
      requirements should be easy. Unfortunately, many state websites don't organize their information in a way that's
      easy to locate. We have presented the information you are looking for in a uniform way and we provide links to the
      primary sources of information so you can verify what we have posted on this site. We also provided a way to get
      CE credit on the bottom of each page on the site.
