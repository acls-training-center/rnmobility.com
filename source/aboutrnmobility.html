    <p>We think finding information about how to transfer your nursing license, renew, and seek continuing education requirements should be easy. Unfortunately, many state websites don't organize their information in a way that's easy to locate. We have presented the information you are looking for in a uniform way and we provide links to the primary sources of information so you can verify what we have posted on this site. We also provided a way to get CE credit on the bottom of each page on the site.</p>
