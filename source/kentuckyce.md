Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

Kentucky is a compact state. If you are moving to Kentucky or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for licensure by endorsement to use your license in Kentucky. General instructions are listed below.

- Completed [Online Endorsement Application](https://kbn.ky.gov/Registered-Nurse/Pages/rn-endorsement.aspx) with \$165 application fee.
  - You may also complete a paper application request form, which costs an additional \$40.
- Complete [State Background Check](https://kbn.ky.gov/Licensure/Pages/criminal-background.aspx).
- Complete [Federal Background Check](https://kbn.ky.gov/Licensure/Pages/criminal-background.aspx) (\$14.75).
- Submit a completed [Verification of Licensure](https://kbn.ky.gov/Licensure/Pages/license-verification.aspx) Form or verification via [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com).
- Complete a Jurisprudence Examination online after submitting the application. More information about the exam can be found [here](https://kbn.ky.gov/Licensure/Pages/jurisprudence-exam.aspx).
- Paper Application Request Form can be accessed [here](https://kbn.ky.gov/state-registered-nurse-aide/Pages/Apply.aspx).

You may [renew your license online](https://kbn.ky.gov/Licensure/Pages/nurse-licensure-compact.aspx) for \$50. Renewals occur yearly before October 31.

Foreign nurses educated outside of the U.S. must complete the [VisaScreen](https://www.cgfns.org/services/certification/visascreen-visa-credentials-assessment/) for Kentucky licensure. For details about the VisaScreen process, click [here](https://kbn.ky.gov/KBN%20Documents/cgfns-visascreen.pdf).

#### Continuing competency

RNs must complete a one-time, 1.5-hour Pediatric Head Trauma course within three years after licensure. You can find a list of providers [here](https://kbn.ky.gov/continuing-education/Pages/Continuing-Education-CE-providers.aspx).

Generally, 14 contact hours (Board approved) or certification (or recertification) in a nursing-related program (must be from a national certifying organization) will satisfy continuing competency requirements. For further information, visit the [Kentucky Continuing competency](https://kbn.ky.gov/continuing-education/Pages/Continuing-Education-Requirements.aspx) page, which includes mandatory courses.

There is also a one-time requirement to take a Domestic Violence CE course within three years of obtaining your KY license, and you must retain documentation until you retire your license. The CE earning period is from November 1 to October 31.
