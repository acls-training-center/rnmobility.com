Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some healthcare professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

Arkansas is a compact state. If you are moving to Arkansas or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for licensure by endorsement in order to use your license in Arkansas. General instructions are listed below.

-   Passing NCLEX results.
-   Graduation from a Board-approved nursing program.
-   U.S. Social Security Number.
-   License verification.
-   Criminal background check.
-   Completed online application and fee of **$125**.

Licenses are renewed on a staggered **biennial birth date system**. The renewal fee is **$100** for RNs.

### Continuing competency

To meet Arkansas' continuing competency requirements, you must complete one of the following:

-   15 contact hours of accredited, practice-focused continuing education.
-   Current certification from a nationally recognized nursing certification body.
-   One college credit hour in a nursing course (grade of C or higher).
