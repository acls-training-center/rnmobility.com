Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

Arkansas is a compact state. If you are moving to Arkansas or claiming it as your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for application by endorsement in order to use your license in Arkansas. General instructions are listed below.

-   Passing NCLEX results
-   Graduation from a Board-approved nursing program
-   US Social Security Number
-   License verification
-   Criminal Background Check
-   Completed online application and fee of $125

Licenses are renewed on a staggered biennial birth date system. The renewal fee is $100 for RNs.

### Continuing Competency

15 contact hours of accredited, practice-focused activity, current certification from a nationally recognized body, or one college credit hour in a nursing course (grade of C or higher) will suffice for your continuing education requirement.
