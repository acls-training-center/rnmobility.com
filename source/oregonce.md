Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

If you are currently licensed and in good standing in the US or one of its territories, you may be eligible for endorsement. Formerly licensed nurses may be eligible too. There are a few education and legal requirements. The nursing program you graduated from must be approved by the Oregon State Board of Nursing (OSBN). Secondly, you will have to undergo the required criminal background check.

The OSBN also has practice requirements. They require you to have a minimum of 960 hours of work experience as a nurse within the last five years. However, if you have recently graduated from an approved program, then you may still be eligible for endorsement.

You will also be asked to verify your license and NCLEX exam results. If you were trained outside the US, you will also need to submit proof of your English language proficiency.

License renewals take place every two years and expire the day before your birthday on even years if you were born on an even year, and on odd years if you were born on an odd year. The cost of renewal is $159.

For foreign educated nurses, [here](https://www.oregon.gov/osbn/pages/forms.aspx) is information for approved independent services for credential evaluations and language proficiency examinations.

#### Continuing competency

Oregon, unlike many other states, does not necessarily have a continuing education requirement. There is a required seven-hour pain management course that is taken online; however, it does not keep an RN from their license.
