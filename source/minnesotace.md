Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

#### Endorsements

Below is a general list of requirements for endorsements. Click [here](https://mn.gov/boards/nursing/licensure/apply-for-a-license/apply-by-endorsement.jsp) to view the [endorsement application page](https://mn.gov/boards/nursing/licensure/apply-for-a-license/apply-by-endorsement.jsp). Nurses can also apply online [here](https://mbn.hlb.state.mn.us/).

-   Submit application and fee (\$105)
-   Submit verification of licensure from the state you were originally licensed in and from the state you are currently licensed in (if it is a different state)
-   Verifications may be obtainable from [www.nursys.com](https://www.nursys.com/)
-   [Confirmation of Nursing Employment for Licensure by Endorsement form](https://mn.gov/boards/assets/Conf_Nursing_Employment_tcm21-586960.pdf)
-   You may need to take a refresher course
-   Social security number
-   [Refresher course criteria](https://mn.gov/boards/nursing/education/education-refresher-course-criteria/)

Licenses are renewed every two years in Minnesota, with renewals costing \$85. Renewals must be completed 30 days prior to the 15th of the licenseeâ€™s birth month; after this date, it will be considered late and incur an additional \$50 late fee. To renew online, click [here](https://mn.gov/boards/nursing/licensure/license-renewal/renew-license.jsp).

The fee for licensure status verification other than through NURSys is \$20. The paper verification form is available in the Licensure by Endorsement application.

#### Continuing competency

You must complete 30 contact hours of continuing education every two years. Of these, at least 1 hour must focus on pain management. The Board does not approve specific CE providers or courses, but this [link](https://mn.gov/boards/nursing/licensure/continuing-ed/) provides information on continuing education resources and links to approved providers.

Foreign educated nurses must submit a Credentials Evaluation Report from either the [Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS)](https://www.cgfns.org/) or the [International Education Research Foundation (IERF)](https://ierf.org/). Additionally, passing an approved English-language proficiency test is required. The options include:
1.  [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](https://www.ets.org/)
2.  [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)](https://ielts.org/)
3.  [Michigan English Language Assessment Battery (MELAB)](https://michiganassessment.org/)
