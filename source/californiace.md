Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of its citizens. However, the requirements for some healthcare professions are not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this page.

**Endorsements**

The following is a general list of requirements for licensure by endorsement:

- Complete application and fingerprint card.
- Appropriate fees.
- A 2 x 2 passport-style photograph.
- Transcripts from the nursing program.
- License verification.

License verification can be obtained through the Nursys Verification system [here](https://www.nursys.com/NLV/NLVTerms.aspx).

For foreign-educated nurses, see the [California RN Licensure Qualifications for Graduates of International Nursing Programs](https://www.rn.ca.gov/pdfs/education/edp-i-35.pdf).

You can apply for licensure by endorsement online at the [BreEZe site](https://www.rn.ca.gov/pdfs/applicants/end-app.pdf) after completing the [Licensure by Endorsement Applicant Identification form](https://www.rn.ca.gov/pdfs/applicants/endidform.pdf).

The **cost** of application is **$350** for domestic applicants and **$750** for international applicants, with an additional **$49** if using a fingerprint card method. A temporary license, if desired, costs **$100** [source: Board of Registered Nursing Fee Schedule](https://www.rn.ca.gov).

**Continuing competency**

**Continuing Education for License Renewal**:

Registered nurses must complete **30 hours of continuing education every 24 months** and pay a renewal fee to retain active licensure status. The provider must be recognized by the California Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) and have an active Continuing Education Provider (CEP) number. You can verify provider status [here](https://www.rn.ca.gov/online/verify.shtml).

College courses may count toward continuing education. One **quarter unit equals 10 contact hours**, and one **semester unit equals 15 contact hours**. Acceptable coursework includes advanced courses in physical, social, and behavioral sciences, as well as patient care strategies, administration, or research [source: BRN Continuing Education](https://www.rn.ca.gov/licensees/ce-renewal.shtml).
