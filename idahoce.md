Each state needs a competent medical workforce to meet the needs of it's
citizens. However, the requirements for some health care professions are
not the same in each state. That is why it is important to find out what
is required of you as a future or current registered nurse before moving
across state lines. Contact information is located at the bottom of this
page.

#### Endorsements

Idaho is a compact state. If you are moving to Idaho or claiming it as
your primary state of residence, you will need to apply for application
by endorsement in order to use your license in Idaho. General
instructions are listed below.

You may [request an endorsement/reinstatement
application](https://ibn.idaho.gov/IBNPortal/LicensureByEndorsement.aspx?Agency=426&Board=IBON)
via telephone, fax or via email, or you may also [download the
application
form](https://ibn.idaho.gov/IBNPortal/IBN/UPDATED%20FORMS%202009/Licensure_by_Endorsement_RN.pdf).
You cannot declare another [compact
state](https://www.ncsbn.org/nurse-licensure-compact.htm) as your
primary state of residence if you are applying for an endorsement of
license.

    does not participate in the online verification system you may
    download and print the [Verification of Licensure
    Form.](https://ibn.idaho.gov/IBNPortal/IBN/Forms/verification_licensure.pdf)

-   There are no continuing education requirements for the state of
    Idaho.

    English-language proficiency through testing. You must also provide
    an official transcript from your nursing program with a certified
    translation in English, or an equivalent credentials report issued
